## Comic characters data

To access the README.md file of the original data scraped by FiveThirtyEight, please go [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/comic-characters/README.md). That README file covers the
marvel-wikia-data and dc-wikia-data csv files. 

*Note:* I did change the 'SEX' category to the more accurate term of 'GENDER'. I also changed the sexuality of a couple characters based on research which can be read more about in the [project](https://megan-vo.shinyapps.io/queer-comic-characters/).

I also added two csv files containing the top 5 Marvel and DC queer characters by number of appearances. The columns of data for those two csv files are listed below:

Variable | Definition
---|---------
`name` | The name of the character
`ALIGN` | The alignment of the character based on whether they are categorized as Good, Bad, or Neutral
`GENDER` | The character's gender
`APPEARANCES` | The character's number of comic book appearances since their first appearance up until September 2, 2014 
`YEAR` | The year of the character's first comic book appearance
`GSM` | The gender or sexuality minority identification of the character (i.e. "Pansexual characters, homosexual characters, etc."). 
`RANK` | The popularity rank of a character by number of appearances 
`PIC` | The image of the character used
`Artist` | The attributed artists of the image used
`Source` | The source (cover, page, etc.) that the image is from
`Date` | The date that the source was published
