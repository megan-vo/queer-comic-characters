# queer-comic-characters
Fun, side project on queer characters from Marvel and DC comics using data scraped from [Marvel](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Marvel_Database) and [DC Wikias](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/DC_Comics_Database) by [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/comic-characters). More information about the
data, where and when it was scraped, and other details can be accessed by clicking the FiveThirtyEight link.

The project is broken down into three parts:

1) Examination of the composition of queer characters by gender and sexuality minority status, gender, alignment, and publishing company throughout the years.
2) A quick look into the top 5 queer character profiles from both DC and Marvel by number of appearances.
3) Comparisons between gender (primarily male/female) and GSM status of all Marvel and DC characters.

Any referenced code used in this project is linked and attributed in the ui.R and server.R files.

Finally, the project and its references can be accessed [here]().
